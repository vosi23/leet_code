# 8. String to Integer (atoi)

Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.

The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:

1. Whitespace: Ignore any leading whitespace (" ").
2. Signedness: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is '-' or '+', assuming positivity if neither present.
3. Conversion: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.
4. Rounding: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [ -2<sup>31</sup> , 2<sup>31</sup> - 1], then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than -2<sup>31</sup> should be rounded to -2<sup>31</sup>, and integers greater than 2<sup>31</sup> - 1 should be rounded to 2<sup>31</sup> - 1.


Return the integer as the final result.

### Example 1:
* Input s= "42"
* Output: 42

### Example 2:
* Input s= " -042"
* Output: -42

### Example 3:
* Input: s = "1337c0d3"
* Output: 1337

### Example 4:
* Input: s = "0-1"
* Output: 0

### Example 5:
* Input: s = "words and 987"
* Output: 0

### Constraints:
* 0 <= s.length <= 200
* s consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (0-9), ' ', '+', '-', and '.'.

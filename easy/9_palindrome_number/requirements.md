# 9. Palindrome number

Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome and false otherwise.
Palindrome: a reversed string which match with the original one.

### Example 1:
* Input: x= 121
* Output: true
* Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and right to left.

### Example 2:
* Input: x= -121
* Output: false
* Explanation: from left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, becomes 121-, therefore is not palindrome.

### Example 3:
* Input: x= 10 
* Output: false
* Explanation: becomes 01

### Constraints:
* -2<sup>31</sup> <= x <= 2<sup>31</sup>-1
